#StaticWebsite + #WordPress blog - #Hosting on #AWS

A very very common scenario where you want to keep your website static or build with #Nextjs SSG, or probably with #Reactjs . On the other hand, your marketing team wants WordPress to write blogs because it's in their conform zone and they don't want to learn anything new.

In a startup, where you don't have much time to deal with all these. You might choose one of the three following options:

Build your entire website with #WordPress using a theme so your content writers feel at home
Create static pages for each blog and deploy them with the static site
Create a custom blogging tool
But hold on, you have another option. It requires a bit of a hassle though for the first time. But it will make your life much easier on the long run.

Serve your website statically using Nginx from one server, and run WordPress on another server. Now use AWS load balancer's smart routing to load blogs whenever someone goes to /blog on your site.
